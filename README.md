## Introduction

This application was developed with the intention of facilitating the work of a small humanitarian association, during the preparation of the Eid al-Adha (an Islamic festival). It allows the recording of contact information of individuals who wish to have their sacrifice performed by the association, as well as the generation of necessary posters to be used in videos serving as proof. Finally, the application allows sending the videos proving the completion of the sacrifice to the concerned individuals.
